## Attribution
This program takes inspiration from the tor-parser program available at
https://github.com/dgoulet/tor-parser for some of it's consensus processing
functions. It also uses a modified version of the JA3 Library located at
https://github.com/salesforce/ja3 to generate SSL fingerprints that can be
used to identify Tor clients.
